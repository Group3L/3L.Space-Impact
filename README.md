SPACE IMPACT

To return again at home in planet Omega75, Jake and Berry have as their hope the only spaceship left after 
the destruction of the mothership and death of their comrades. Wandering through space they encounter an alien 
swarm of spaceships that they need to destroy in order to arrive home safely. In different levels alien spaceships 
will come and the player has to destroy them. Different alien spaceships will launch rockets towards the player 
and try to neutralize it. The player has only three lives available and at the end of each level the player will 
face a boss spaceship. According to the time spent in each level and killing of the enemies, the player will collect 
points that will be added to its score. In the end of the level the killing of the boss gives extra points.

Will you help Jake and Berry arrive home safely?
